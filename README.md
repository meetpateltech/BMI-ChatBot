# BMI-ChatBot
Body Mass Index Chatbot using Python3

# BMI Chatbot
This is a simple chatbot that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person based on their height and weight. The user will be prompted to input their height and weight in meters and kilograms respectively, and the chatbot will calculate the BMI using the formula BMI = weight / (height ^ 2). The chatbot will then classify the user's weight as underweight, healthy, overweight, or obese based on the BMI value.

## How to use
Clone this repository or download the bmi_chatbot.py file.

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the bmi_chatbot.py file is located.

Run the command python bmi_chatbot.py

Follow the prompts to enter your height and weight.

The chatbot will calculate your BMI and provide a conclusion based on the value.

## Note
Please note that the BMI is not the only measure of fitness or health and it may not be suitable for everyone. Some people such as athletes or bodybuilders may have a high BMI due to muscle mass. 

Therefore, it's always good to consult with a doctor or a health professional for a better understanding of your health.
